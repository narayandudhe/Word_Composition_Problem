I have implemented the Trie datastructure to search a word from list of words. 
We first read the file with list of words then insert the list to the Trie datastructure. The trie datastructure 
will create a tree using each word in the list.

Maximum number of children of a node is equal to size of alphabet. Trie supports search, insert and delete operations in O(k) time where k is length of key/word. This is obviously faster than BST and Hashing. and we can efficiently do Prefix search.

Tool to display the longest word made up of multiple words. Implements the Trie data structure for faster searching. Processes millions of words in couple of seconds.
